> [!CAUTION]  
> Inferno was primarily developed to suit my personal use cases, so it may not fully meet yours.  
> However, it is designed to be as generic as possible to support common project structures, which might make it useful for others as well.  
> It works well for small to medium-sized projects (not yet tested on larger ones).
